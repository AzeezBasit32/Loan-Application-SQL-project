# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes home credit loan applications to assess default risk using SQL. The dataset contains synthetic records of loan applicants, including demographics, financial details, credit scores, and loan outcomes.

## Objectives
- Load and clean home credit loan data in MySQL.
- Perform exploratory data analysis on credit risk factors.
- Implement stored procedures for risk assessment and reporting.

## Getting Started
1. Place `raw_data.csv` inside `datasets/`.
2. Run `data_import.sql` to create and populate the database.
3. Use `data_cleaning.sql` to preprocess and refine data.
4. Execute `stored_procedures.sql` for analytical insights.
5. Review `cleaned_data.csv` in the `results/` folder.

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Query Language:** SQL
- **Data Processing:** Pandas (for CSV handling, optional)
- **Visualization:** Power BI / Tableau (for insights, optional)

## Next Steps
Now, let's proceed with writing `data_import.sql` to import the dataset into MySQL.
